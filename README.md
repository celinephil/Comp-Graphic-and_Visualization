## Competency
> Create realistic, interactive three-dimensional objects through the use of application programming interface (API) libraries and best practices. Create interactive graphics applications that respond to input devices allowing for successful navigation around three-dimensional objects and  through  three-dimensional space. Employ best practices in formatting, commenting, and functional logic that produce reliable computer programs. Additionally, develop fully formed graphic applications that meet project requirements.

## Scenario :memo:
Write computer code that commands any OpenGL graphics processing unit (GPU) to create, texture, light, render, and animate 3D models in 3D space, and control virtual environments relative to a virtual camera.

Address the following critical elements: 
* Your 3D object will be assessed visually to ensure it meets the elements below: 
    * Utilize organized geometry, ensuring that polygons (triangles) on the 3D model are well spaced and connected and give a low-polygon representation of a real-world object.
    * Utilize textures, ensuring that high-resolution textures are projected accurately on the 3D model.
    * Generate lighting, ensuring that all lights are implemented to give a professional-looking presentation and visualization of the model.
    * Apply color to lighting with varying intensities. 
* Navigation Through Input Devices: Your applications will be navigated by using the mouse and keyboard input devices to control a virtual camera. The elements below must be met: 
    * Create horizontal orientation navigation of the 3D object in the application allowing for azimuth orientation of a virtual camera that orbits a lit model when the mouse is moved horizontally. 
    * Create vertical orientation navigation of the 3D object in the application allowing for altitude orientation of a virtual camera that orbits a lit model when the mouse is moved vertically. 
    * Create code to clamp or gimbal lock azimuth and altitude orientation to prevent irregular camera angles (e.g., a 90-degree camera rotation clamp on the pitch axis).
    * Create perspective and orthographic displays of the 3D object so that the user can change the viewport display of the 3D model from 2D to 3D and vice versa, using the tap of a keyboard key, allowing the user to switch between orthographic (2D) and perspective (3D) views at will. 
* Syntax Assessmentâ€”Best Practices: These best practices should be evident within your program:
    * Employ formatting best practices by providing program code that is easy to read and follows industry-standard code formatting practices, such as indentation and spacing.
    * Utilize commenting best practices, ensuring that project source code used is briefly and clearly explained using descriptive comments.
    * Employ functional coding logic best practices, ensuring that the program runs as expected

## Reflection :pencil2:	
Designing software can be a complex scenario though it doesn't always have to be. There are a number of ways to approach programming and endless outcomes for results. I like to approach software by making an initial plan and following each step thoroughly to reach the final picture. Additionally, asking for help or using resources to assist in my endeavors has helped me in the past in designing software that is fully functional and efficient. 

The project helped me gain new deisgn skills that assisted in crafting a 3D scene and developing code, overall. Attention to detail and following best practices has helped me produce better code. During this project, there were times where patience and attention to detail were vital for completing a functional and logical program. Since this was one of the hardest projects I have had to work on, I realized it more in this course because of the amount of coding required for creating a 3D scene using OpenGL. I also implemented a better and improved indent style for my code so that users can have an easier time reading and following each line. 

For my project, I followed the basic programming process which includes: identifying the objective and goal, creating a layout, writing the code, running and debugging the code, and going back to fix any issues or looking for a better method or solution to reach the endgoal. Tactics from my design approach can be applied in future work whether in schoolwork or professionally by consistent use so that the concept can be easily retained and reproduced. Additionally, it is important that every programmer has a design approach they can use so that the result of their work is successful. 

Developing programs has provided me with a different experience each time. I enjoy approaching developing programs by formulating an initial plan and overview of the project. To proceed, I like to create a schedule that I can utilize to focus on each step as I progress through the development process. When it's time to begin developing, writing code is a good start but in my approach, I like to consider it a rough draft. From the "rough draft" I determine better fitting functions or areas that need improvement. Testing the code is next and finally I review and determine if the code has been fully completed and there are no additional fixes or edits needed to be conducted.

While working on the 3D scene, I was able to develop a strategy that allowed me to better utilize my time. Such strategy included removing distractions in my work area as well as starting work at a specific time each day. The months in this course, I was able to set an alarm specifically for starting the assignments. Though, you may notice in my code and 3D scene that there are no lighting. This was due to my minimal focus during a point in this course. Since I was taking 3 different courses during this term, it was easy for me to fall behind. Despite this, I was able to clear my mind and successfully complete my work by the end of the term.

Iteration factor most definitely had a major role in my development process. During the first week, we had to review the project guidelines. I was nervous because of how intimidating it sounded. Working in iterations helped because it allowed me to focus on different areas to reach the final result. Each week (module), we were assigned with completing a specific part for our project. Had it been all jumbled up, this would have caused me to stress out even more than I did. It was important to me to work piece by piece or section by section because of the many requirements. I allowed myself to work on one thing at a time so that I wouldn't feel bombarded or overwhelmed even if that meant turning in late work. I knew the outcome of turning in late work but I also knew how important it is for me to finish step by step so that I understand the information being taught. 

My approach to developing code has evolved throughout the milestones because I have been able to recognize the minute errors or details within my code that I wouldn't have caught before. Additionally, it has helped me realize what was working and what wasn't working. From this, I was able to determine the best means or methods to improve by. Building code by section throughout the milestones led me to the project's completion.

Computational graphics and visualizations give me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future education pathway because it makes me knowledgeable of the magic that happens behind a screen. Additionally, it allows me to better understand how it has been used and the role it has played in different fields and industries such as the gaming and entertainment industry. It gives me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future professional pathway by making me more focused and using effort to make something happen. In this course, as stated earlier, I fell behind and I knew that I had to get myself out of that hole. Gaining the momentum to keep moving forward and achieving the highest goal has and will be my goal in my future endeavors.
