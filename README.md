### How do I approach designing software?

Designing software can be a complex scenario though it doesn't always have to be. There are a number of ways to approach programming and endless outcomes for results. I like to approach software by making an initial plan and following each step to reach the bigger and final picture. Additionally, asking for help or using resources to assist in my endeavors has helped me in the past in designing software that is functional and efficient. 

* What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

The project helped me gain new deisgn skills that assisted in crafting a 3D scene and developing code, overall. One design skill in particular is attention to detail and using a particular indent style for my coding format has helped me. During this project, there were times where patience and attention to detail were vital for completing a functional and logical program. Since this was one of the hardest projects I have had to work on, I realized it more in this course because of the amount of coding required for creating a 3D scene using OpenGL. I also implemented a better and improved indent style for my code so that users can have an easier time reading and following each line.
