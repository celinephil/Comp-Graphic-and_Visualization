## Competency
> Create realistic, interactive three-dimensional objects through the use of application programming interface (API) libraries and best practices. Create interactive graphics applications that respond to input devices allowing for successful navigation around three-dimensional objects and  through  three-dimensional space. Employ best practices in formatting, commenting, and functional logic that produce reliable computer programs. Additionally, develop fully formed graphic applications that meet project requirements.

### How do I approach designing software?

Designing software can be a complex scenario though it doesn't always have to be. There are a number of ways to approach programming and endless outcomes for results. I like to approach software by making an initial plan and following each step to reach the bigger and final picture. Additionally, asking for help or using resources to assist in my endeavors has helped me in the past in designing software that is functional and efficient. 

* What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

The project helped me gain new deisgn skills that assisted in crafting a 3D scene and developing code, overall. One design skill in particular is attention to detail and using a particular indent style for my coding format has helped me. During this project, there were times where patience and attention to detail were vital for completing a functional and logical program. Since this was one of the hardest projects I have had to work on, I realized it more in this course because of the amount of coding required for creating a 3D scene using OpenGL. I also implemented a better and improved indent style for my code so that users can have an easier time reading and following each line. 

* What design process did you follow for your project work?

For my project work, I followed the basic programming process which includes: identifying the objective and goal, creating a layout, writing the code, running and debugging the code, and going back to fix any issues or looking for a better method or solution to reach the result. 

* How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Tactics from my design approach can be applied in future work whether in schoolwork or professionally by consisten use so that the concept can be easily retained. Additionally, it is important that every programmer has a design approach they can use so that the result of their work is successful. 

### How do I approach developing programs?

Developing programs has provided me with a different experience each time. I enjoy approaching developing programs by formulating an initial plan and overview of the project. To proceed, I like to create a schedule that I can utilize to focus on each step as I progress through the development process. When it's time to begin developing, writing code is a good start but in my approach, I like to consider it a rough draft. From the "rough draft" I determine better fitting functions or areas that need improvement. Testing the code is next and finally I review and determine if the code has been fully completed and there are no lines to fix.

* What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

While working on the 3D scene, I was able to develop a strategy that allowed me to be utilize my time better. Such strategy included removing distractions in my work area as well as starting work at a specific time each day. The eight weeks in this course, I was able to set an alarm specifically for starting the assignments in this course. Though, you may notice in my code that there are no lighting. This was due to my minimal focus during a point in this course. Since I was taking 3 different courses during this term, it was easy for me to fall behind. Despite this, I was able to complete my work by the end of the term.

* How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration factor most definitely had a major role in my development process. During the first week, we had to review the project guidelines. I was nervous because of how intimidating it sounded. Working in iterations helped because it allowed me to focus on different areas to reach the final result. Each week (module), we were assigned with completing a specific part for our project. Had it been all jumbled up, this would have caused me to stress out even more than I did. It was important to me to work piece by piece or section by section because of the many requirements. I allowed myself to work on one thing at a time so that I wouldn't feel bombarded or overwhelmed even if that meant turning in late work. I knew the outcome of turning in late work but I also knew how important it is for me to finish step by step so that I understand the information being taught. 

* How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My approach to developing code has evolved throughout the milestones because I have been able to recognize the minute errors or details within my code that I wouldn't have caught before. Additionally, it has helped me realize what was working and what wasn't working. From this, I was able to determine the best means or methods to improve by. Building code by section throughout the milestones led me to the project's completion.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science can help me reach my goals in a plethora of ways. One way is by allowing me to gain exposure to the real world workings of software development and implementing best practices to my future coding. 

* How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Computational graphics and visualizations give me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future education pathway because it makes me knowledgeable of the magic that happens behind a screen. Additionally, it allows me to better understand how it has been used and the role it has played in different fields and industries such as the gaming industry. 

* How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

It gives me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future professional pathway by making me more focused and using effort to make something happen. In this course, as stated earlier, I fell behind and I knew that I had to get myself out of that hole. Gaining the momentum to keep moving forward and achieving the highest goal has and will be my goal in the profesional pathway.
